# Python To do List

## What is this project?
This is a simple To do list graphical user interface (GUI) that I'm developing using **Python's** Tkinter library with what I learned from my studies of [Tkinter documentation](https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/index.html).

All code will be written in **Python3.8**.

## Development Process
 ### User Interface
 The first I'll Create the user interface items completely inoperative, only containing the application layout. The app will have a **mainwindow** with the main features, a **dialog** that'll be displayed to add new tasks to the list and another one to edit the created tasks.

## Future Implementations:
 ### Mainwindow:
 - A combobox to choose between different task lists ðŸš§
 - A Search entry to find a task on the grid ðŸš§
 - An add Task Button that'll bring up a dialog asking ðŸš§
 - An entry for quick tasks ðŸš§

 ### New task dialog
 - An entry to type what task should be done ðŸš§
 - Another entry for the date and time ðŸš§
 - A combobox to choose in what list the task will be added ðŸš§

 ### Edit task dialog
 - Basically everything in the new task dialog ðŸš§

 ### Storage system ðŸš§
