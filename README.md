## What is this project?
This is a simple To do list graphical user interface (GUI) that I developed using **Python's** Tkinter library with what I learned from my early studies of [Tkinter documentation](https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/index.html).

All code was written in **Python3.8** and the storage of tasks is done through a .json file that is updated always a task is added or removed.

## Application features
 - Simple task addition and removal;
 - Storage of the tasks.

## Future implementations:
- Storage of the tasks ✔️
- Dates 🚧
- Different task lists 🚧
- Social media interactivity 🚧
