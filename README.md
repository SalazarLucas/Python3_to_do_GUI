# Python To do List
## What is this project?
This is a simple **Python graphical user interface (GUI)** To do list that I developed using Tkinter library with what I learned from my early studies on [Tkinter documentation](https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/index.html).

All code was written with **Python3.8**

## Future implementations:
- Storage of the tasks
- Dates
- Different task lists
