# Python To do List

## What is this project?
This is a simple To do list graphical user interface (GUI) that I'm developing using **Python's** Tkinter library with what I learned from my studies of [Tkinter documentation](https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/index.html).

All code will be written in **Python3.8**.

## Development Process
 ### User Interface
First I'll Create the user interface items completely inoperative, only containing the application layout. The app will have a **mainwindow** with the main features, a **dialog** that'll be displayed to add new tasks to the list and another one to edit the created tasks.

After the creation of all elements of the interface, I'll develop the code to make it functional and operant.

The storage system is yet to be planned.

## Future Implementations:
 ### Mainwindow:
 - A combobox to choose between different task lists âœ”
 - A Search entry to find a task on the grid âœ”
 - An add Task Button that'll bring up a dialog âœ”
 - An entry for quick tasks âœ”

 ### New task dialog:
 - An entry to type what task should be done âœ”
 - Another entry for the date and time âœ”
 - A combobox to choose in what list the task will be added âœ”

 ### Edit task dialog:
 - Basically the same as the New task dialog ðŸš§

 ### Storage system ðŸš§
