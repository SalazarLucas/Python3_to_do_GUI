# Python To do List

## What is this project?
This is a simple To do list graphical user interface (GUI) that I developed using **Python's** Tkinter library with what I learned from my studies of [Tkinter documentation](https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/index.html).

All code will was written in **Python3.8**.

## Development Process
First I Created the user interface items completely inoperative, only containing the application layout. After the creation of all elements of the interface, I built the code to make it functional and operant. The storage system works using a json file to save unfinished tasks.

## What this project helped me to learn?
This little project helped me to develop a better sense on object oriented programming concepts specially inheritance and association. Creating new classes inheriting from tkinter classes to build a simple application was really helpful to create an organized and relatively easy to configure code.
