# Python To do List
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SalazarLucas/Python3_to_do_GUI/master/images/to_do_list.png" alt="Application image">

## What is this project?
This is a simple To do list graphical user interface (GUI) that I developed using **Python's** Tkinter library with what I learned from my early studies of [Tkinter documentation](https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/index.html).

All code was written with **Python3.8**

## Future implementations:
- Storage of the tasks
- Dates
- Different task lists
