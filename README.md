# Python To do List

## What is this project?
This is a simple To do list graphical user interface (GUI) that I'm developing using **Python's** Tkinter library with what I learned from my studies of [Tkinter documentation](https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/index.html).

All code will be written in **Python3.8**.

## Development Process
 ### User Interface
First I'll Create the user interface items completely inoperative, only containing the application layout. After the creation of all elements of the interface, I'll develop the code to make it functional and operant. The storage system is yet to be planned.
